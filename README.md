# WebVR-Vision
<br>
You can check the representation at [here](https://cs1.ucc.ie/~mw16/CS6105/Lab4/117227893.html).<br>
<br>
In this WebVR vision, I build a WebVR vision with Three.js library based on javascript. <br>
<br>
To build a tense and dark environment, the sky is set to a sunset situation with the help of SKY library. Furthermore, I also add some fog around the background.<br>
<br>
The Floor is a plane which with standard material textured by grass image.<br>
<br>
There are four 3D models loaded into the environment, one Voldemort, one Harry, one billboard and the main campus building of UCC.<br>
All these models have been scaled and set in a suitable position. All models have shadows added by traverse function.<br>
<br>
There are also three balls incorporated by three different shaders which are considered as magic balls to fight with each other. And these balls are also set some self animation.<br>
<br>
The lighting is resulted with one environment light and one spotlight. And the default animation of spotlight is move as a circle in a certain height with the light focus on original point. <br>
<br>
The campus tour also achieved with a similar way. The animation method of light and camera can be controlled by one GUI. Also, 
the GUI can set the position, intensity and some other properties of spotlight.<br>
